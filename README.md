# EcoLearn-Machine-Learning-Assisted-Recycling-with-mBot

## Project Overview
For our project, we want to use the mbot robot that we used for COMSC-243 Human Robot Interaction. The basic overview of what our robot does is that it identifies if a particular object is biodegradable or non-biodegradable by looking at the label of the object (in particular it looks at the symbol that most products have to differentiate) and then sorts it in 2 different piles. The main component of the robot that we need to implement is a camera that can properly identify the label and then arms to be able to sort in 2 different piles, using Python coding.
